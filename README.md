# Uber Data Analysis Project

## Problem Description
This project analyzes Uber ride data in New York City to identify trends, patterns, and insights that can help understand the behavior of Uber rides over time and locations. The primary focus is on understanding which times and places have the highest Uber activity, as well as which Uber bases have the most active vehicles.

## Project Goals
- Analyze Uber ride data to identify peak months, days, and hours.
- Determine which locations in NYC have the highest Uber activity.
- Assess the performance of different Uber bases.
- Create visualizations to present the findings effectively.

## Data Analysis Summary
This project involves several steps, including data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization. The key findings include:
- June has the highest number of Uber pickups.
- There is a clear pattern of hourly rush, with peaks in the morning and evening.
- Certain Uber bases have significantly more active vehicles than others.
- Heat maps reveal hotspots of Uber activity across NYC.

## Hardware and Software Used

- **Software:** 
  - Python 3.x
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - pandas
  - NumPy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - plotly
  - folium

## Detailed Explanation of Steps and Files
### Step 1: Importing Modules
Essential libraries and modules are imported to facilitate data analysis and visualization.

### Step 2: Checking Files in Directory
The dataset files are listed to ensure the necessary data files are available for analysis.

### Step 3: Reading Our File
The datasets are read into pandas DataFrames for analysis.

### Step 4: Checking Shape of Dataset
The dimensions of the datasets are checked to understand the data's structure.

### Step 5: Data Preprocessing
- **Step 5.1: Dropping Duplicate Values:** Ensures data quality by removing duplicate records.
- **Step 5.2: Fixing Datatypes:** Corrects datatypes, particularly converting date columns to datetime format.
- **Step 5.3: Checking and Fixing Missing Values:** Identifies and handles missing data appropriately.

### Step 6: Performing Analysis for Problem Statements
- **Step 6.1: Monthly Analysis:** Determines which month has the most Uber pickups.
- **Step 6.2: Hourly Analysis:** Analyzes the hourly distribution of Uber rides.
- **Step 6.3: Base Analysis:** Examines which Uber bases have the most active vehicles.

### Step 7: Data Collection and EDA
- **Step 7.1: Location Analysis:** Uses heat maps to visualize rush locations in NYC.
- **Step 7.2: Time Analysis:** Calculates rush hours as pairs of (Hour, Weekday) and visualizes them.

## Data Collection Methodology
The data was collected from Uber's public datasets for NYC. These datasets include ride information such as pickup date and time, location, and base number.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involved removing duplicates, fixing datatypes, and handling missing values. This step is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis.

## Visualization Creations
Various visualizations were created to present the findings, including:
- Bar charts for monthly and hourly analysis.
- Box plots and violin plots for base analysis.
- Heat maps for geographical analysis.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides valuable insights into Uber's operations in NYC, highlighting peak times and locations for Uber rides. These insights can be used by Uber to optimize their services and by city planners to understand transportation patterns.

## Future Steps and Improvements
- Include more recent data to update the analysis.
- Perform a deeper analysis of factors influencing Uber ride patterns, such as weather and events.
- Explore machine learning techniques to predict future Uber ride trends.

This project showcases the power of data analysis and visualization in uncovering insights from large datasets. The methodologies and tools used can be applied to various other domains and datasets for similar analyses.
